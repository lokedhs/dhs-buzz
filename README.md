Google Buzz was the precursor to Google+, and was shut down shortly
after Google+ was released to the public.

Google never made their own Android client for this social network,
but instead had a completely open API. DHS Buzz was an Android client
for Buzz that I wrote during a few months, mainly in order to satisfy
my own need for an Android client. I put it up for free on the Google
Play store, and it was somewhat popular.

Since Buzz has been shut down for years, and this code has been
lingering on my hard drive ever since, I figured that I would just
release the source code under a permissive license (BSD) in case there
are people out there that would like to have a look at it.
