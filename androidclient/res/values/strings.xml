        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note that the authentication will fail if you are not using the standard Android browser as the default.&lt;/b&gt; In
        particular, it is known that Firefox will fail to return the correct information to DHS Buzz, thus preventing
        authentication.
        &lt;p&gt;If you face this problem, please make sure that you are using the standard Android browser during this process.
        After authentication is done, you can switch back to the browser of your choice.

        if you could inform me at info@dhsdevelopments.com so that
        the problem can be investigated.
